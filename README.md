A systematic calibration transfer and quantification method has been proposed, named principal components extreme learning machine 
and extreme learning machine (PCELM-ELM). The first PCELM means calibration transfer method that project spectra to principal 
component space base on extreme learning machine. Subsequently, ELM represents a regression model based on extreme learning machine 
for quantify key components in transfer spectra.
